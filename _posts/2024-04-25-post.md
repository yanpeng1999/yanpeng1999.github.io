The CHSH inequality, named after the authors Clauser, Horne, Shimony, and Holt, is used to experimentally prove Bell's theorem (1969). 
This theorem asserts that local hidden variable theories cannot account for some consequences of entanglement in quantum mechanics. 
The violation of the CHSH inequality is used to show that quantum mechanics is incompatible with local hidden-variable theories. 
This is an important experiment for understanding the foundation of quantum mechanics.
